Actions are anything that can go in battle._actions
Listeners are anything that can go battle._listeners
Lines in the csv are either actions or listeners, some are also moves though
Moves are just starting-point actions that may trigger other actions or Listeners
Actionables are functions in the actionables folder, which may be used to compose actions and listeners


Actionables all have exactly these parameters: (cxt, params = {})
